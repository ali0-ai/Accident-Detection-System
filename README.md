# Secure: Unilever Safety Hack - Intelligent Accident Detection and Helmet Monitoring System for Biker Safety

## Abstract

This project, conducted as part of the Unilever Safety Hack by Team "Secure," aims to create an innovative solution for improving biker safety through an Intelligent Accident Detection and Helmet Monitoring System. The primary goal is to develop a robust system capable of promptly alerting emergency contacts or safety organizations in the event of an accident while simultaneously monitoring helmet usage.

## System Functionalities

### Accident Detection System

Leveraging sensor technologies, the system continuously monitors the motion and orientation of the bike. In case of a sudden impact or irregular movement indicative of an accident, the system triggers an automatic alert. This alert is then transmitted to pre-registered emergency contacts, safety organizations, or relevant authorities, providing real-time information on the accident location.

### Helmet Monitoring System

The project emphasizes promoting and ensuring helmet usage among bikers. Integrated sensors detect whether the rider is wearing a helmet. If the system identifies a lack of helmet usage, it generates a notification to the rider and transmits an alert to their emergency contacts, highlighting the importance of adhering to safety measures.

## Key Features

- User-friendly mobile application for bikers to register emergency contacts, receive alerts, and view safety statistics.
- State-of-the-art sensor technologies, potentially incorporating accelerometers, gyroscopes, and RFID/NFC-based helmet monitoring.

## Implementation

The Intelligent Accident Detection and Helmet Monitoring System aligns with Unilever's commitment to promoting safety and well-being. This project has the potential to significantly reduce response times post-accidents, enhance overall road safety, and encourage responsible biking behavior through helmet usage monitoring.

## Conclusion

Team "Secure" aims to contribute to a safer biking environment by developing a comprehensive solution that combines accident detection and helmet monitoring. This initiative ultimately enhances the safety of bikers and reduces the severity of road accidents.
